Sensor data is erratic, and the crew of our science vessel reports strange disturbances: wildly visceral dreams, a persistent sense of being watched, fitful hallucinations...\n\nDespite the frustrating lack of useful telemetry, it seems clear we have stumbled on a tunnel through uncharted reaches. A dangerous path, yet the rewards may be great; on the tunnel's far side lies a distant corner of the galaxy."

Sensor data is erratic, but the hive has been disturbed. A persistent feeling of being watched pervades us, the distinct sense that something looms just beyond the tunnel's mouth.\n\nDespite the frustrating lack of useful telemetry, it seems clear we have stumbled on a passage through uncharted reaches.

 # Mercenary Enclaves
 enclave.2.name: "Mercenary Enclave Foundation"
 enclave.2.desc: "We are debating whether or not to help set up the [fleet.GetName] as an independent §YMercenary Enclave§!. The proposal, first put forward by the fleet commanders, would result in us losing control of the fleet. We would also be responsible for providing them with a sizeable investment in §YEnergy Credits§! and §YAlloys§!. In return, they would give us a number of shares in the company. These would come with periodic dividends and special privileges.\n\nThey assure us that in times of need, they will always be ready to fight for us. And our money."

 enclave.25: "Mercenary Enclave Destroyed"
 enclave.25.desc: "Our fleet has overcome the defenses of the mercenaries in [merc_system.GetName], and their station has been blown to pieces. The rest of the [FROM.GetName] collapsed quickly after, and their remaining fleets have disbanded. While some of the surviving captains may turn to piracy, others have announced their plans to honor smaller contracts, offering logistical support or space station garrisoning. But such trifling affairs are of little consequence. The important fact is that the Mercenary Enclave is no more, and from its wreckage we have been able to salvage a sizable amount of resources."
 enclave.26.desc: "Word has reached us that a Mercenary Enclave has been destroyed by the [mercenary_destroyer.GetName] in [merc_system.GetName]. The aggressors proved too strong for the [FROM.GetName] to face on their own, and the station housing the Board, barracks, and their shipyards was destroyed. The mercenary fleet disbanded shortly after, as every captain was left to fend for themselves, but some representatives have stated that they will honor the company's contracts in logistics and starbase garrisoning as best they can despite the dissolution of the Company."
 enclave.26.a: "La pagheranno per questo."
 enclave.27: "Emergency Fleet Recall"
 enclave.27.desc: "Dear valued client,\n\nAs we currently find ourselves under attack, we have urgent need to recall our own forces. As per our contract, we will immediately enact clause 285b.15, and our fleet will leave your service as soon as this notice reaches you. We look forward to renewing our partnership once this unfortunate situation is resolved, and apologize for any inconvenience."

We of the [mercenary_enclave_country.GetName] are ready to let bygones be bygones - after all, conflict may be profitable, but not when it comes between business partners.

 enclave.215.c: "We wish to terminate our contract."
 enclave.220.desc: "Our garrisons offer exceptional value. However, please keep in mind that at [mercenary_enclave_country.GetName] we frown upon the term 'mercenary.' The word is too blunt, and carries far too many negative associations. Our 'defense contractors' are standing by to prepare your station for the arrival of our 'safety specialists.' Once we're on site, these specialists will begin drilling the station crew to bring out their best. \n\n At [mercenary_enclave_country.GetName] we aim to train only the finest peacekeepers."

 enclave.240.b: "La Tempesta Grigia"
 enclave.240.c: "The Prethoryn Swarm"
 enclave.240.d: "The Extradimensional Invaders"
 enclave.240.e: "The Contingency AI"
 enclave.245.desc: "The Khan's ships present an overall well rounded composition, with no clear weakness. Our analysts suggest that torpedoes might perform well to take their ships down, but caution against specialized defense. A mix of both shields and armor is probably your best bet to keep your ships alive. The Khan has proven to be an extremely competent commander and underestimating them would be a terrible mistake. Consider their retinue as an extreme menace."
 enclave.250.desc: "The Gray Tempest relies on two complementary weapon types: energy beams and strike craft. The former is countered by shields, but shields are bypassed by their strike craft. Our projections show that ships fitted with point defense in addition to shields have a much better chance to survive the engagement. Nanite ships are extremely well protected, but torpedoes might help in breaching their defenses."
 enclave.255.desc: "Prethoryn fleets rely on slow moving projectiles and hosts of smaller ships to take down their foes. One option to fend them off is to use point defense, coupled with armor and improvements to your ship's hull resilience; another is to engage them at extreme range. With sufficiently powerful energy weapons, one might manage to destroy their fleets before they can even get in range."
 enclave.260.desc: "The Unbidden's exclusive reliance on energy gives us an obvious weakness to exploit. Weapons dealing extra damage to their shields should prove devastating, but if you can fit weapons that completely bypass their shields, they won't be long for this dimension. Defensively, you should look at bringing your own shields to the fight to adequately counter their energy beams."
 enclave.265.desc: "Contingency ships exclusively use energy weapons- as such, it is best to use shields to mitigate incoming damage. Simulations indicate that despite having strong defense, their ship's hulls are relatively fragile. Our analysts estimate that penetrating weapons might perform very well against them."

 enclave.270.desc: "Looking to pacify a colony or uproot terrorists? Our planetside support services offer companies of trained professionals, ready to work in challenging and high-risk environments to help you bring order to the galaxy."

Note how efficiently they round them up and handle them. A marvel of military precision."

 enclave.280.c.timeout: "The enclave is still upgrading with our tech. We can share new technologies with them after §Y[event_target:mercenary_enclave_country.updating_databanks_timer]§!."
 enclave.285.desc: "You certainly understand that recalling a fleet is a sensitive matter. We have of course prepared the necessary loopholes in all our standard contracts, but we will need at least six months to bring the fleet back, and a... generous compensation to avoid upsetting our current customers.\n\n We believe that this course of action is not in the best interests of our organization, but you are our patron - we'll make it happen if you wish it so."

As per contract stipulations: this notice serves as your 3-month warning before the fleet must leave your service. We enclose the generous compensation to which you are entitled.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience, and wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors."
 enclave.294.b: "We needed those ships!"

Our dedicated experts will make sure that your ships are equipped with all they need, from ammunition to food, down to the last bolt on your temperature regulators. Additionally, we will set up supply depots ahead of the fleet, or broker provisioning contracrs with local civilian companies. Your ships deserve the best care, and we are here to provide it."

As per the terms of our contract: if we do not receive prompt instructions to do otherwise, you will be automatically billed for renewal of this service.\n\nWe trust that you are satisfied, and look forward to doing more business with you!"

It seems likely that far from being 'returned from death', [hero_redivivus.GetName] was in some way transported to a realm akin the Shroud. [hero_redivivus.GetHisHerCap] experience of this 'afterlife' was apparently a contented one, and [hero_redivivus.GetHisHer] has now settled into a quiet existence on the outskirts of the capital, preaching a doctrine of fearlessness and peace to any who will listen."
