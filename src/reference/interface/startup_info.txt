Winterly Greetings!

It is November, and thus, we present a new Custodian patch!

Breathing new life into stories told many times before, we have added a smörgåsbord of new early-game anomalies and events to freshen up your experience.

For Humanoid Aficionados, we are adding one more new civic to the Humanoids DLC, the Pompous Purists.

In addition, we have included many bugfixes and smaller improvements, including a slew of graphical fixes, AI improvements, and performance optimizations, which you can find detailed in our patch notes.
