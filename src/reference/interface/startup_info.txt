Greetings!

The Custodians have arrived!

Shaping your empire has become more freeform than ever, as Selectable Tradition Trees have been added to the game. This means you can now select the traditions you wish to pursue throughout the game, choosing from the already existing ones or some of the newly added traditions that also arrive with this update.

Several Origins and Civics, like Shattered Ring and Necrophage, have been re-balanced to bring them more in line with each other or unlock combinations that were not allowed before (Necrophage Hiveminds).

With this patch we have also added new content to several existing DLCs, specifically the Plantoids and the Humanoids Species Packs, with a new origin and several new civics and species traits.

In addition, we have included many bugfixes and smaller improvements that you can find detailed in our patch notes.
