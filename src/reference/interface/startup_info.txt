Greetings, and welcome to a new Custodian patch!

The 3.3 "Libra" update includes significant gameplay changes making Unity a more valuable resource with many more uses.

Planetary Ascension Tiers are a new way to let you upgrade your core worlds, improving the effects of planetary designations and reducing planetary sprawl.

The Necroids DLC now also gives Megacorps their own twist on Reanimators with the Permanent Employment civic.

In addition, we have included many bugfixes and smaller improvements, including a slew of graphical fixes, AI improvements, and performance optimizations, which you can find detailed in our patch notes.
